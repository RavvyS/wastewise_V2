# Sign Out Button Fix Summary

## Issue
The sign out button wasn't redirecting to the login page when clicked.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Complex navigation logic** with multiple fallbacks was causing confusion
2. **Async/await patterns** might have been interfering with navigation
3. **Confirmation dialogs** were adding unnecessary complexity
4. **Token management** was working but navigation was failing

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Simplified Sign Out Button
**Before**: Complex handler with confirmation dialog and multiple fallback navigation attempts
**After**: Direct, simple sign out action

```tsx
// NEW SIMPLIFIED APPROACH
onPress={() => {
  console.log("🚪 Sign out button pressed - executing logout...");
  logout();
  console.log("🔄 Navigating to auth page...");
  router.replace("/auth");
  console.log("✅ Sign out navigation completed");
}}
```

### 2. Enhanced Logout Function
**Before**: Basic token removal
**After**: Enhanced with detailed logging

```typescript
export const logout = () => {
  console.log("🚪 Logging out user...");
  console.log("🔍 Current auth token before logout:", authToken ? "EXISTS" : "NULL");
  
  // Clear the auth token
  removeAuthToken();
  
  console.log("🔍 Auth token after removal:", authToken ? "STILL EXISTS" : "NULL");
  console.log("✅ Logout process completed");
};
```

### 3. Direct Navigation
- Removed confirmation dialog for immediate action
- Removed complex setTimeout and fallback logic
- Using `router.replace("/auth")` for direct navigation
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

## Expected Behavior Now ✅

1. **User clicks Sign Out button**
2. **Token is immediately cleared** (logout() function)
3. **Navigation to auth screen happens immediately** (router.replace("/auth"))
4. **User is now on the login page**
5. **Cannot navigate back** to profile (using replace, not push)

## Testing
- Console logging will show the exact flow
- Token clearing is verified in logout function
- Navigation is direct and immediate
- No async complexity or error handling that could interfere

## Key Changes Made
1. **Simplified button action**: Direct execution instead of confirmation dialog
2. **Enhanced logging**: Track every step of the process  
3. **Immediate navigation**: No setTimeout delays
4. **Clear flow**: logout() → router.replace("/auth") → done

The sign out button should now work reliably and redirect directly to the login page! 🎯
