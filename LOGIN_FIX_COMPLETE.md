# 🔧 Login Connection Issue - FIXED!

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**
The login was failing with `ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT` because:

1. **Backend Server Not Running** ❌
2. **Wrong IP Address** ❌ (was using `172.28.31.179`, now `172.28.21.159`)
3. **Network Connectivity Issues** ❌

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### 1. **Started Backend Server**
```bash
✅ Backend server now running on PID 70544
✅ Listening on port 5001
✅ All API endpoints accessible
```

### 2. **Fixed IP Address**
```typescript
// BEFORE (wrong IP)
API_BASE_URL = 'http://172.28.31.179:5001'

// AFTER (correct IP)  
API_BASE_URL = 'http://172.28.21.159:5001'
```

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added 10-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
- Better error messages for different failure types
- User-friendly connection error alerts

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing**
```
✅ Backend connectivity: Working
✅ User registration: Working  
✅ User login: Working
✅ JWT authentication: Working
```

## 🎯 **Test Credentials (Working)**

For immediate testing, use:
- **Email**: `testlogin@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

## 🚀 **Current Status**

**Backend Server**: ✅ Running (PID 70544)
**API Endpoints**: ✅ All functional
**Database**: ✅ Connected to Neon PostgreSQL
**Network**: ✅ Properly configured
**Authentication**: ✅ JWT tokens working

## 📱 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the mobile app** - Login should now work perfectly
2. **Use test credentials** above for immediate verification
3. **Backend will stay running** until you restart your computer

## 💡 **Why It Failed Before**

The key issue was network connectivity:
- Backend server wasn't running
- IP address had changed (common with DHCP)
- No timeout handling caused hanging requests

**Now everything is working! 🎉**
